            Real-time visualization for interactive applications in mechanical engineering</br>
            Presenting large, complex, high-tech milling machines to customers is a challenge. For presentation at trade fairs, a machine has to be produced, assembled, tested, dismantled, packed, shipped and installed at the trade fair, which is an enormous logistical feat. It is true that an impressive machine is then on site, but in only one configuration.

            Gebr. Heller Maschinenfabrik GmbH regularly faces this challenge.
            Together with echolot GROUP, we took on and mastered this challenge in the context of digitalization and new possibilities. echolot is an agency that specializes in holistic brand positioning and management.
            Instead of the real machine, a digital twin is presented on a gigantic cube of screens.
            This allows the sales department to respond optimally and individually to customers' wishes and questions. To realize this idea, we show an interactive application on the cube.
            The application covers a wide range of real features and represents a virtual 1:1 mapping. These virtual models are the "digital twin". When talking to customers, sales staff navigate to individual information points, remove the virtual machine cover and start animations. In this way, functions that are difficult to explain can be communicated in a playful way.
        </p>
        <h3>Update</h3>
        <p>In 2020 parallel to the launched V-Con (virtual fair) the machine got a face lift and also I updated the application with the new model a new input system with additional support for touch devices and the ability to stream the application for usage on low end devices through the Unity service Furioos.</p>
