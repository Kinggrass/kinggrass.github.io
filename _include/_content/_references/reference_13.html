    <div id="description" style="display:none;">
        <p>A firm handshake, a friendly smile to greet you, a face-to-face situation: that's what makes a sales talk, a trade show, a training session - and at the same time it's impossible in this age of Corona and social distancing. Fortunately, digitalization is opening up new approaches and instead offers virtual space for interpersonal contact and a three-dimensional experience. This is also the case on this unique virtual platform V-Brand.</p>

                The mechanical engineering company Heller relies on the joint solution of apollon and echolot.GROUP and organizes the V-CON for the first time with the V-Messe. Together with partners, Heller conducted the interactive and international event format from November 10 to 12, 2020. The virtual trade fair is aimed at customers, industry professionals and journalists who want to get a close-up look at the latest manufacturing solutions and move directly from the machine to adjacent solutions ranging from tools to measuring and testing technology to automation. The V-CON is set up as a freely accessible 3D world with the opportunity to exchange information at the click of a mouse. Around 200 experts from Heller and its partners will be available with their know-how via chat or (video) call. The start on Tuesday, November 10 at 9 a.m. holds an exciting panel discussion on digitalization in manufacturing. In addition to a comprehensive look at the various facets of manufacturing solutions, the digital trade show will also feature the new generation of the HF 5-axis machining center, which offers comprehensive flexibility for use in a wide range of industries.

            <h3>My expirience</h3>
            <p>
                My superior asked me if we could develop a convention which is only held virtual because he got the reqeust himself from our partner ECHOLOT and I answered yes of course why not we see it alot in the video game industry, MMO-games where alot of people are gathering and forming communities and exchange with each other.</br>
                Of course the main focus of this request was not for games but to build up a platform where people can meet and explore a world on a bussines level. But the principle was the same with another setting and some other requirements.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                After some weeks and workshops with our partner ECHOLOT the vision was more clear to me and also some edge requirements which should be met. </br>
                Two huge challenging requirements where that it should run on alot of low-end hardware devices like tablets and notebooks which main usage area is only for offices and office applications over the browser.</br>
                And the other one was that we only had three to four months time.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                So first of all I validated which technology and framework we can use that is working on all targeted hardware devices and operating systems.</br>
                And I have come to the conclusion that Babylon.js which we used in some smaller projects earlier was fitting.</br>
                Babylon.js is a game engine framework targeted for the web which is abstracting alot of functionality under the hood including rendering interfaces like webgl or webgpu.</br>
                Something I don't like on this framework is that it has alot of hierarchical class dependencies and alot of functionality is kept explicit as classes.</br>
                This is making the seperation of concerns more difficult and also task seperation can not be done easy anymore.</br>
                Gameengines nowadays are following more or less the principle of an entity compontent system or a component pattern at least thats makes development inside a interactive realtime application more easier and seperatable.</br>
                Babylon.js has something similar with so called "Behaviours" but is very limited.</br>
            </br>
                At this point I decided to write our own entity component system which is working with Babylon.js. And made development with the engine far more easier again and task bundles could be realted to components again.</br>
                Then I validated all desired requirements and made a UML-chart which should visualize the software architecture we are going in the team and all components with their data which has to be developed to fullfill the requirements.</br>
            </br>
                From now on our team of three to four people begann to programm.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the development we got some 3D-models of the world which should be included and visualized. Unfortunatly the models where not optimized for game engines although we marked it as a requirement for the models.</br>
                So we had to optimize them ourselfs which I have done with the PiXYZ software which I had used in alot of previous projects. For this project I wrote a custom optimization pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end I can say that it was a challenging but fun project and hope that all end users had a nice and a very intuitiv expirence with this application.
