        <p>Even more service with custom-fit offers - that was the demand of our customer HELLMUT RUCK. That's why we implemented an online configurator for the pioneer in foot care. RUCK customers can now configure practice equipment such as cabinets, chairs and special furniture in the online store and order them directly. The special feature: A detailed view of the product from all possible angles. And this in real time during product configuration!

                Customers of Hellmut Ruck GmbH in Neuenbürg have recently been able to configure and purchase products for practice equipment such as cabinets, chairs and special furniture in the online store. With around 7,000 products, 250 employees and its own school for podiatry, Ruck is a leading and innovative manufacturer, specialist dealer, trainer and consultant for podiatry, foot care, cosmetics and wellness. The special feature of the configurator solution is that all equipment variants can be rendered and visualized in real time. This enables a very detailed view during configuration from all possible angles. Since Ruck also offers its customers complete room concepts, the products can also be viewed in the desired room concept. With every change or addition to the configuration, the current price is displayed via an interface to the ERP system. At the end, orders can be placed directly or, alternatively, contact can be established with a customer consultant. This was made possible by the use of state-of-the-art 3D technology and because CAD data was available for all products.

            <h3>My expirence</h3>
            <p>
                When I got the request if we can make a product configurator, I thought for sure but that will be really much effort. Our company then decided to start this as a pilot project together with our customer Ruck.</br>
                After we had some workshops with our customers and got some modular article components as CAD data, I started with a prototype and quickly developed the basic idea of a graph system that allows to make configurations and serialize them in a way that this could be applied to almost all products, as we also had to make a configurator for different types of products such as chairs, kitchens and mobile podiatrist cabinets. Even recursive configurations are possible with this to a limited degree.</br>
                So we had a basic system to rule them all. </br></br>
                The configurator should run natively as an app with better quality on different operating systems, as well as on the web, so that end customers can configure and order this in it.</br>
                I chose Unity because at the time it was possible to do this, but during development it became clear that a separate solution for the web would have been better, but it would have taken more development time.</br>
                Nowadays this would work much better for the web with Unity Forma but today I would go for native web engines like Babylon.js or Three.js.</br>
                Nevertheless, we came to a really good result, where the application is connected to the ERP and the store and new articles can be automatically fed into the configurator including automatic preparation and conversion of the CAD product data.</br>
                Via a generated code, each configuration can be clearly recalled, no matter what changes have been made to the configuration, be it materials or parts. And the best part the whole configuration can be donwloaded also over the web to be used in 3D room planning programs.</br>
                </br>
                This project was also very challenging and a lot of fun.
