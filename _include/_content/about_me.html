            From 2013 until 2017 I studied computer science with a specialization in media and games. The topic of my bachelor-thesis was “Volumetric Cloud Rendering for Real-Time Applications“ and the results can be seen under references.
            As mentioned you can see some projects under refernces I worked on or participated in the past during my study or in my free time.

            To my person I can say that I'm passionate about games in general. I like it to play games in my free time, if possible. But I'm also interested in the scientific part of a game. So in the past, I have been dealt with how games and current technologies are implemented.
