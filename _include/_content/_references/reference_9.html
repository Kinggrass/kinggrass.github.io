                SEDUS stands for high-quality and intelligent office equipment - for over 145 years. However, this long tradition does not stop the specialist for office equipment from using innovative means to make its professional claim clear. This also includes the use of current media to support the customer in planning and decision-making. The use of configurators and planning tools is therefore a matter of course for SEDUS.
However, it is even more impressive to be able to experience the planned office furnishings live and in 3D. And this is exactly what we were able to realize with M+M CG STUDIOS for SEDUS: a VR experience! It allows the customer to simulate and experience the planned furnishings in the virtual showroom or even in their own spatial conditions by means of VR glasses.
In addition to the actual user experience, the creation of the virtual reality application was also about introducing the viewer to the new medium as simply and playfully as possible.</p>

<p>For this purpose, we jointly designed an onboarding that first introduces the user to the operation of the VR application. This also familiarizes the user with the still unfamiliar way of perception. This is an excellent opportunity to present current products, news and the history of SEDUS in a tangible way.
After this short preparation, it's time for action! And the customer can explore his individually planned SEDUS office to his heart's content during the actual VR experience.</p>

<p>The collaboration with the VR team from M&M was enriching and inspiring for us. The fun we had together is reflected in our unique result. We are hungry for more.</p>
