            Traditional mail order companies are facing more and more competition from digital retailers. Both industry giants such as Amazon and young companies with top market access are expanding the field of competition for renowned distance sellers.
</br>The classic catalog in particular - still often the justified leading medium in distance selling - seems outdated in the face of this competition for young buyers. An expansion of sales channels is therefore a desirable, rejuvenating goal. This was also the case for our customer K - Mail Order.
</br>Together we were looking for an innovative solution to meet and inspire customers on completely new levels. The idea: the VR showroom.

                In an internal idea pitch at K - Mail Order, the idea was born to use a VR showroom as a sales promotion tool. As a long-standing partner of Klingel, we were allowed to implement the technical solution described below.
            </br>Designed as a Cardboard application, the customer's smartphone is converted into VR glasses. Using the app developed for this purpose, the customer can enter a virtual showroom packed with products from K - Mail Order. From sofas to home accessories, the digital space offers an impressive insight into the KLiNGEL world of living.
        </br>The individual functions of the products, for example the conversion of a sofa into an extended sofa bed, are simulated in the app. Likewise, the user can switch between different color variants of the products. These functions are supplemented by superimposed text sequences that represent the descriptive attributes of the products. Price information is also displayed directly to the customer. As a wish list, products that excite the customer can be transferred to a shopping cart to result in a direct purchase decision in favor of the products.
    </br>The VR showroom was made available to a customer test group of 480 users and found excellent acceptance with a 74% approval rate. Feedback ranged from a simple "WOW!" to the statement "I'm overwhelmed. I don't even know what to say.".
</br>For many consumers, virtual reality continues to be a novel experience that pays heavily into the innovative brand image of the implementing company. Especially in light of the technological future, this is a groundbreaking tool to pick up rejuvenated buyer groups and create a true unique selling proposition.
</br>We are proud of this groundbreaking cooperation!</p>
